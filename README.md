# NASA Space App 
This is an app that allows you to type in a date using the YYYY-MM-DD format, and the background changes to NASA's photo of the day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA's API, Daisy UI 

As a science educator, I love to find different hooks to get kids learning about space, and to get them thinking outside of the box. This app shows an array of beautiful photos. I built it by creating a the HTML layout and linking it up with tailwinds, and daisy ui. In my client in JavaScript, I wrote JavaScript for fetching the NASA photo of the day, and setting it to the background. 

<!--## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!-->

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time working with tailwind and daisy ui! This made designing my app a breeze and allowed me to focus on the JavaScript.
